TESTING suggestions for eval:
1) no such file or directory
	./pipex nofile ls ls outfile.txt
	< nofile ls | ls > outfile.txt
2) permission denied
	create file noperm with chmod 000
	./pipex noperm ls ls outfile.txt
	< noperm ls | ls > outfile.txt
3) command not found
	./pipex infile.txt x y outfile.txt
	./pipex infile.txt x ls outfile.txt
	< infile.txt x | y > outfile.txt
	AND permutations of x ls, ls x etc
4) complex command flags
	./pipex infile.txt "grep oh" "wc -w" outfile.txt
	< infile.txt grep oh | wc -w > outfile.txt
